    "### Introduction\n",
    "Hotels are a major part of the hospitality industry, that are considered to have a large economic impact to our community. Hotels provide accomodation, entertainment and leisure,both to local and international tourists. Due to their large target population(local and international), hotel reservation system has became a necessary component inorder to expand their customer base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hotel reservations systems are a convenient and easy way for customers to access hotel services.\n",
    "Hotel customers also have the ability to cancel their hotel reservations in advance and receive a full refund or encounter some charges depending on the situation.This is a very convenient feature of hotel reservations to the customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Hotel business is a very profitable business in the current era.However any hotel can encounter great losses when there is an increase in the churn rate (cancellation of hotel reservations).This is because hotels require constant maintenance whose cost can only be accounted for when the hotel business is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to develop a model that can predict whether a customer will cancel their hotel reservation or not based on certain features.With this model,hotels can be able to anticipate and counter any predestined hotel reservation cancellations.\n",
    "In addition the model will provide insight on the features that influence the churn rate in the hotel business.This will enable hotel managers to mitigate the churn rate in the hotel business  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Being part of the hotel management, the company is been experiencing a dropping hotel revenue collection, which can be linked to the decreasing number of reservation bookings and increased reservation churning / cancelations. Therefore to mitigate this, we have been tasked with to come up with strategies, solutions and recommendations that will be aimed at increased revenue collection in the hotel by, increasing the hotel bookings and reducing the rate of reservation cancelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, we will undertake data analysis on the companies reservation data in order to find patterns that can improve revenue collection and hotel bookings as well as developing a model that can predict hotel churning inorder to effectively solve them before their occurence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### research questions\n",
    "\n",
    " * Is the reservation churn rate the same in the various hotel categories?\n",
    " * Which are the busiest months in hotel bookings and which months receive the most cancellations?\n",
    " * Which reservation channel (e.g., online travel agencies, direct booking, etc.) leads to the most bookings, and which channel is associated  with the highest reservation cancellations?\n",
    " * Which countries contribute to the most bookings, and which countries are associated with the highest reservation cancellations?\n",
    " * Which hotel features/services need improvement?Can these improvements lead to a significant reduction in the churn rate?\n",
    " * What are the key factors that influence hotel reservation cancellations?\n",
    " * can we develop a predictive model to anticipate and mitigate reservation cancellations in the hotel business\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Objective\n",
    "This project is aimed at providing appropriate recommendations / strategies that will increasing hotel revenue and to develop a model that can predict hotel churning / cancelation and its major causes and how to mitigate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the reservation churn rate in different hotel categories  and identify if there are significant differences among them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the busiest months for hotel bookings and identify the months that experience the highest number of reservation cancellations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate the impact of different reservation channels (e.g., online travel agencies, direct booking) on the number of bookings and cancellations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify the countries that contribute the most to hotel bookings and those associated with the highest reservation cancellations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess and identify the key hotel features/services that may need improvement to reduce reservation cancellations and enhance customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the key factors that influence hotel reservation cancellations, taking into account various customer-related, booking-related, and hotel-related features.\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop a predictive model using machine learning algorithms that can anticipate reservation cancellations with a high level of accuracy (80% and above).\n",
    "### Metrics of Success\n",
    "\n",
    "- To provide insights on the factors that influence the churn rate in the hotel business. \n",
    "- The final model should have an accuracy score of 80% and above.\n"

    "## Data Understanding\n",
    "***\n",
    "The datset contains information collected from two hotel categories; resort and city hotel with a structure of 31 variables and 119,390 observations, with a ratio of 34% to 66% respectively for the two hotels. Each row represents booking done within the period 1st July,2015 and 31st August,2017 and the bookings that were checked-in and the ones canceled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was extracted from hotels’ Property Management System (PMS) SQL databases from different hotel categories ,resort and city,in Portugal. Dataset download [link](https://bit.ly/2WvQbhJ)\n",
    "\n",
    "The information contained in this dataset will be used to train out model.The columns (features) will provide great insight once used to train the model."
